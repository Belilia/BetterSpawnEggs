Better Spawn Eggs
=================

SpawnEggs is a minecraft mod that adds NBT-editable Spawn Eggs to the game.

The mod adds a new CreativeTab, which contains copies of the vanilla eggs
and new eggs. Special entities like Powered Creepers are built into the mod,
requiring you to change no NBT tags whatsoever. 

However, modders/map makers can modify these eggs and add their own NBT data.

Special tags:

- String: mobID -- The EntityID to spawn
- String: displayName -- The name/name-key for the Spawn Egg
- Integer: primaryColor -- The primary color of the Spawn Egg
- Integer: secondaryColor -- The secondary color of the Spawn Egg
- Compound: spawnData -- The compound tag containing custom spawn information
